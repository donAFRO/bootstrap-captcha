bootstrap-captcha
=================

A jQuery plugin that along with Bootstrap and Font-Awesome will create a stylish, secure, modal validation window.
Your users will appreciate the use of clear visual (randomized) icons instead of hard to read `captchas`. The mouse movment validation will allow developers to discover that the user is indeed a human and not a bot! 
Work in progress begun 6/6/2013 much more to follow including mobile/touch version and updating the $.fn namespace.
